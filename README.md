# Codestra-React-Flow

An internal visual funnel editor with authenticated project save/load. Public landing and signup pages remain in the shared Landing-Pages frontend; Breero retains its business backend responsibilities.

## Run locally

Use Node 22 or later.

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Without identity configuration, local drafting works and save/load remain disabled. Copy `.env.example` to a private local environment file and supply the approved staging settings. VITE_KEYCLOAK_URL, VITE_KEYCLOAK_REALM and VITE_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID are public configuration, never secrets. Keycloak uses authorization-code + PKCE S256; access tokens stay in memory and refresh before API requests.

Set CODESTRA_GATEWAY_ORIGIN to the approved staging gateway origin. The development proxy forwards only `/api/v1/marketing`, preserves the path, verifies TLS, and does not follow redirects. Loopback HTTP is allowed only for local test gateways. Do not target a backend or production host. In a static deployment, configure the hosting server's same-origin proxy to the existing Codestra gateway; Vite's development proxy is not included in the built files.

## Project behavior

The signed session supplies the workspace. The client sends a bearer token and a unique X-Correlation-ID on every request. The backend independently verifies identity, scope and ownership.

Create and save an react-flow project; load it later, paginate through saved projects, or begin a new local draft. Save sends the loaded version; a conflict leaves the draft available for reconciliation. New draft and loading a different project replace unsaved local edits. No autosave, publication or workflow execution occurs.

Saved graph JSON is validated before loading or saving. Nodes retain IDs, finite positions and text labels; edges retain IDs and valid source/target connections. Unknown rendering properties are stripped. The current editor supports up to 2,000 nodes and 4,000 edges.

The API contract is owned by [Codestra-Marketing-Backend](https://github.com/appolon1908/Codestra-Marketing-Backend). Its native gateway registration and registry changes are review candidates; real gateway activation and Keycloak configuration have not been applied. The bundled integration catalog is informational and all providers remain disconnected. The legacy `server/index.mjs` is a read-only catalog/test stub, not project storage and not the editor's API transport.

## Checks and review

```sh
npm run format:check
npm test
npm run build
npm audit --audit-level=high
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:browser
```

Browser tests use synthetic identity and intercepted project API responses to exercise the actual editor. They do not certify live Keycloak or Kong. On dev-desktop, `CHROME_BIN=/usr/bin/google-chrome npm run test:browser` uses the installed browser. See [verification](docs/VERIFICATION.md).

Work is on an atomic bootstrap branch. The repository began empty. An empty subsection/bootstrap-editor commit supplies the first PR review base; all application files are proposed on the atomic branch. Preserve the untouched local starter worktree and require review before promotion. No main/development/testing/staging/production branches, protection settings, or deployments are created by the application. CODEOWNERS and CI are included; the observed repository ruleset list was empty. Require independent review and `Editor checks / editor-checks` before any promotion.
